The PAKM System is a web based application designed for the Make-It-All company.

their tasks towards their projects and for leaders to manage their projects
and analyse the progress of theirs projects. The system is also design to record
information that might later be useful to employees.

designed to be used through Google Chrome on Windows 11, however, care has been taken
to ensure that the system is simple and intuitive to use on any web browser and on
any device.
